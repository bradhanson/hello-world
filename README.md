# hello-world
My inaugural Git repository

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This is the start of my software development career!  I will use Git to keep track of my projects that I will do while prepping for a coding bootcamp.  Best practices are very important to me, so I am going to be using versioning software from day 1.

Hopefully I will create some cool things along the way and maybe this GitHub account will be part of my portfolio that I can show to potential employers!
